## Docker and Docker Compose Installation Guide 
This document provides step-by-step instructions for installing Docker and Docker Compose.

### Prerequisites
  A computer with a 64-bit operating system (Windows 10 or later, macOS, or Linux)
### Installing Docker
There are two main ways to install Docker:

* Docker Desktop: This is the easiest option for most users. It provides a graphical user interface (GUI) for managing Docker containers and images. You can download Docker Desktop for your specific operating system from the official Docker website: https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/
* Docker Engine: This is the command-line interface (CLI) version of Docker. It's more lightweight and preferred for advanced users or server environments. Installation instructions for Docker Engine vary depending on your operating system. Refer to the official Docker documentation for detailed instructions: https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/

### Verifying Docker Installation
Once you've installed Docker, open a terminal window or command prompt and type the following command:
```
docker --version
```
This command should output the Docker version information, confirming successful installation.

### Installing Docker Compose
Docker Compose is a tool for defining and running multi-container applications. It is the key to unlocking a streamlined and efficient development and deployment experience. Refer to the official Docker documentation for detailed instructions: [https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/)
